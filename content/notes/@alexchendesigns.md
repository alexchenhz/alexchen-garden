Created this Instagram account to showcase some of my favorite photos. I've tried making photography portfolio websites in the past, but I find it takes too much effort to manage. I wanted a place to upload and share my photos with minimal barriers.

<div id="curator-feed-default-feed-layout"><a href="https://curator.io" target="_blank" class="crt-logo crt-tag">Powered by Curator.io</a></div><script type="text/javascript">
/* curator-feed-default-feed-layout */
(function(){
var i,e,d=document,s="script";i=d.createElement("script");i.async=1;i.charset="UTF-8";
i.src="https://cdn.curator.io/published/a5a2903b-c91e-4f53-8191-93731d0e4823.js";
e=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];e.parentNode.insertBefore(i, e);
})();
